Insufficient research exists concerning the correlation between SCP-001 and all other known items. However, it has been established that every event regarding the discovery of a new SCP item has followed a report on that same item appearing beneath the cover sheet of SCP-001. The current administration regards this coincidence as proof of causal connection.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/jonathan-ball-s-proposal", "class": "Keter", "pic": "0", "acs": false, "adult": false}
