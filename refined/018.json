{"name": "SCP-018", "desc": "SCP-018 has the appearance of a Super Ball made by the Wham-O company in 1969. It is six (6) centimeters in diameter and coloured red. Found when the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 company was hired to clean out a warehouse that had Wham-O merchandise in it, SCP-018 was noted to be able to bounce with extreme height. At first thought to be a pleasant child's toy, SCP-018 was able to bounce with over two hundred percent (200%) efficiency (that is, if dropped one (1) meter, it would bounce two (2), then four (4), then eight (8), then sixteen (16)).\\n\\nThe ball soon became a dangerous projectile, reaching speeds estimated at over 100 km/h and damaging property and injuring five (5) in the city of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It came to a rest after several days in the nearby lake of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and was retrieved by SCP personnel. Due to the speed of the object, and the total surprise by its victims, no cover-up story was required or initiated.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-018", "class": "Euclid", "pic": "0", "acs": false, "adult": false}
