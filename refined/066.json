{"number": "SCP-066", "name": "Eric's Toy", "desc": "SCP-066 is an amorphous mass of braided yarn and ribbon weighing approximately one kilogram. Strands of SCP-066 may be taken individually and manipulated; when this is done, a note on the diatonic scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B) is produced by the object.\\n\\n**Incident 066-2:** On April 18, 2008, D-066-4437 was instructed to use a pair of scissors to remove a portion of SCP-066 for testing. However, when he began to cut it, SCP-066 rolled one meter away from him before stopping and making an unidentified squeaking sound. Before he could be provided with further instruction, D-066-4437 attempted to cut it again; SCP-066 rolled away and produced the phrase \"Are you Eric?\" in response. After D-066-4437 replied in the negative, SCP-066 morphed into its present state and began emitting loud, dissonant staccato notes until D-066-4437 was escorted from the room.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-066", "class": "Euclid-impetus", "pic": "http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-066/yarn1.jpg", "acs": false, "adult": false, "authors": "Communism will win, Unknown Author"}
