{"name": "SCP-1000", "desc": "SCP-1000 is a nocturnal, omnivorous ape, classified in the Hominini branch along with genera Pan and Homo. They have grey, brown, black, red, and occasionally white fur.\n\nSCP-1000 evolved alongside Homo sapiens, existing contemporaneously with proto-humans and humans in large numbers until 10,000-15,000 years ago, when an extinction event eliminated all but 1-5% of their population. This event was triggered by SCP-1000 contracting an anomalous \"pseudo-disease\" classified as SCP-1000-f1.\n\nThe effect of SCP-1000-f1 is as follows: Any hominid (including humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and non-immune instances of SCP-1000) that directly or indirectly observes any instance of SCP-1000 has a minimum 2% chance of being instantly killed through anomalous means via permanent cessation of brain function. This percentage is cumulative, and the longer a human views SCP-1000, the higher the chance of instantaneous death increases, at a rate of +1% chance per 20 minutes of viewing.", "hook": false, "acs": false, "flops": false, "pic": "https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1000/bigfoot_patterson01-new.png", "class": "Keter", "adult": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000"}
