Explorations that diverged from said route have resulted in immediate loss of contact with participating subjects. The sole safe road may only be traversed in a single direction, and any attempt by subjects to turn back and return the way they came will result in similar loss of contact. \n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo", "class": "Keter", "pic": "http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/taboo/Up-in-the-Air_Gabriela-Pinto_CC2_edited2.jpg", "acs": false, "adult": false, "footer": "\nby PeppersGhost"}
