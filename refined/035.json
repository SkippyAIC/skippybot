{"name": "SCP-035", "desc": "SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask, although, at times, it will change to tragedy. In these events, all existing visual records, such as photographs, video footage, even illustrations, of SCP-035 automatically change to reflect its new appearance.\\n\\nA highly corrosive and degenerative viscous liquid constantly seeps from the eye and mouth holes of SCP-035. Anything coming into contact with this substance slowly decays over a period of time, depending on the material, until it has decayed completely into a pool of the original contaminant. Glass seems to react the slowest to the effects of the item, hence the construction choice of its immediate container. Living organisms that come into contact with the substance react much the same way, with no chance of recovery. Origin of the liquid is unknown. Liquid is only visible from the front, and does not emerge or is even visible from the other side.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-035", "class": "Keter", "pic": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/scpcb_gamepedia/images/4/41/SCP-035.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/150?cb=20150525003837", "acs": false, "adult": false}
