{"number": "SCP-3008", "name": "A Perfectly Normal, Regular Old IKEA", "desc": "SCP-3008 is a large retail unit previously owned by and branded as IKEA, a popular furniture retail chain. A person entering SCP-3008 through the main entrance and then passing out of sight of the doors will find themselves translocated to SCP-3008-1. This displacement will typically go unnoticed as no change will occur from the perspective of the victim; they will generally not become aware until they try to return to the entrance.\\n\\nSCP-3008-1 is a space resembling the inside of an IKEA furniture store, extending far beyond the limits of what could physically be contained within the dimensions of the retail unit. Current measurements indicate an area of at least 10km^2 with no visible external terminators detected in any direction. Inconclusive results from the use of laser rangefinders has led to the speculation that the space may be infinite.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3008", "class": "Euclid", "pic": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Bdg_IKEA_4_5-2015.jpg/640px-Bdg_IKEA_4_5-2015.jpg", "acs": false, "adult": false, "authors": "Mortos"}
