{"name": "SCP-3000", "desc": "SCP-3000 is a massive, aquatic, serpentine entity strongly resembling a giant moray eel (Gymnothorax javanicus). The full length of SCP-3000 is impossible to determine, but is hypothesized to be between 600 and 900 kilometers. The head of SCP-3000 measures roughly 2.5m in diameter, and sections of the body proper are as large as 10m in diameter.\n\nSCP-3000 is carnivorous, and despite its sedentary nature is capable of moving quickly to dispatch prey. Despite its size, it is hypothesized that SCP-3000 does not require sustenance to maintain its biological functions. While SCP-3000 excretes a thin layer of a viscous, dark grey substance classified as **Y-909**.\n\n**The Y-909 compound, originally discovered by the late Dr. Adam Hollister, is a critical component in several modern and experimental amnestic compounds.**", "hook": false, "acs": false, "flops": false, "pic": "https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3000/gaslight.png", "class": "Thaumiel", "adult": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3000"}
