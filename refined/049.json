{"name": "SCP-049", "desc": "SCP-049 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears the appearance of a medieval plague doctor.\\n\\nSCP-049 is capable of speech in a variety of languages, though tends to prefer English or medieval French. While SCP-049 is generally cordial and cooperative with Foundation staff, it can become especially irritated or at times outright aggressive if it feels that it is in the presence of what it calls the \"Pestilence\". Although the exact nature of this Pestilence is currently unknown to Foundation researchers, it does seem to be an issue of immense concern to SCP-049.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-049", "class": "Euclid", "pic": "http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-049/SCP-049D/medium.jpg", "acs": false, "adult": false}
