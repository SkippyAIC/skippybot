{"name": "THE KNOB", "number": "SCP-7143-J", "desc": "SCP-7143-J is a doorknob on the door to the third floor staff dormitory at Site-19. It is made of metal. Turning it to the right or left opens the door to which it is affixed. It has a lock, which is used to impede the intended action of turning the doorknob so as to not allow individuals to access the rooms beyond\n\nNotes:\n*Agent Romerville: I use that doorknob sometimes to get into the third floor dormitory.\nDr. Cornwall: One time, the doorknob was locked. When I came back later, it was unlocked. This is how locks work.\nResearcher Axwell: Sometimes I turn it to the left, and sometimes to the right. Doors are useful.\nDr. Lee: I once saw somebody cleaning SCP-7143-J. It's nice that our facilities workers take such good care of the site.*", "authors": "djkaktus", "hook": false, "acs": false, "flops": false, "pic": "https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7143-j/knob.JPG", "class": "N/A", "adult": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7143-j", "footer": "Researcher Chambers: I would fuck the shit out of that doorknob.", "color": "0x00ff00"}
