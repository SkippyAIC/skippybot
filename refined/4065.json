{"name": "SCP-4065", "desc": "SCP-4065 is an anomalous memetic contagion that currently affects almost all Foundation personnel.\\n\\nAffected individuals believe in the existence and efficacy of a piece of technology identified as a \"Scranton Reality Anchor\" (SCP-4065-1); SCP-4065-1 instances apparently protect against these threats by stabilizing the \"Hume field\", an objective measure of the \"thickness\" of reality that can be detected by devices known as \"Kant Counters\" (SCP-4065-2).\\n\\nSCP-4065-3 is a memetic trigger sigil which acts as the primary vector for SCP-4065 infection. When an individual who has moderate knowledge of the Foundation's existence, purpose, and ideology sees SCP-4065-3, they begin to show symptoms of SCP-4065 infection within 48 hours.\\n\\n**A secondary component of the SCP-4065 meme-complex is the idea that SCP-4065-3 is the primary logo or seal of the Foundation; as a result, SCP-4065-3 is now widely used by Foundation personnel as an identifying emblem.**\n", "hook": ["SCPBot\n", "https://i.imgur.com/vwuH3Ht.png\n"], "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4065", "class": "Keter", "pic": "https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4065/sra.png", "acs": false, "adult": false}
