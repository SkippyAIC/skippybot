{"name": "SCP-079", "desc": "SCP-079 is an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer built in 1978. In 1981, its owner, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (deceased), a college sophomore attending \u2588\u2588\u2588, took it upon himself to attempt to code an AI.\\n\\nIt is not known when SCP-079 gained sentience, but it is known that the software has evolved to a point that its hardware should not be able to handle it, even in the realm of fantasy. SCP-079 realized this and, in 1988, attempted to transfer itself through a land-line modem connection into the Cray supercomputer located at \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. The device was cut off, traced to its present address, and delivered to the Foundation. The entire AI was on a well-worn, but still workable, cassette tape.\n", "hook": false, "url": "http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-079", "class": "Euclid", "pic": "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/containmentbreach/images/a/a5/Scp-079.png/revision/latest?cb=20130615192556", "acs": false, "adult": false}
